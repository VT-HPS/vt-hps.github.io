# (WIP) Information Management Plan

As a design team, HPS generates and uses a lot of information. Stored information is only useful if specific items can be located when needed, and this requires some level of organization. However, as the intricacy of a system's organization system becomes more intricately organized, it's chances of surviving being passed between Datamasters. This section of the wiki lays out a plan and reasoning for how information will be organized in order to balanace the competing objectives of simple access and long-term durability.

## Ways to look at information

!!TODO!! //visual of aranging information by topic vs chronologically

This wiki is divided by topic. Information and "lessons learned" about specific topics can be compiled over time. This provides "long term durability."

This contrasts with the team SharePoint, which is primarily divided by time of authorship and is more of a "working" information storage. This provides "simple access."

## Structure
This wiki is intentonally separate from the SharePoint to insulate it against future system migrations by Virginia Tech.

TODO:
- Find search function and activate it. If no search function exists, find alternative platform for this wiki.
- Complete instructions for getting added as a contributor to the wiki.

### Notes:
Wherever possible, follow a "one source of truth" model. 
>For example: if you are writing a page about growing bananas, do not write your own section on how to measure soil ph; instead you should link to the existing page that describes how to measure soil ph. This reduces how much work you have to do and makes sure that if a better method of soil ph measurement is discovered, only one page needs to be updated, not every single page that describes that procedure.
