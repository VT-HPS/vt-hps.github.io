# Wiki Style Guide (WIP)
Please this page completely before editing the wiki, and please return to it any time you are unsure. If you notice something is not conforming to the style guide, please tell the current team Datamaster.

## File naming conventions
>Sometimes the GitHub wiki system that this site is built on doesn't play nice with files that use spaces as line separators. To avoid problems, no folder or file name should use spaces as seperators.

**Folders** are to use **underscores** (_) as seperator characters.

**.md files** are to use **hyphens** (-) as seperator characters.
