# Wiki Layout Plan

Information on this wiki is divided by topic.

This is in contrast to the team SharePoint, which is primarily divided by time of authorship.

Wherever possible, follow a "one source of truth" model. 
>For example: if you are writing a page about growing bananas, do not write your own section on how to measure soil ph; instead you should link to the existing page that describes how to measure soil ph. This reduces how much work you have to do and makes sure that if a better method of soil ph measurement is discovered, only one page needs to be updated, not every single page that describes that procedure.
