>Always remember: you are the squishiest thing in a shop!

Machining is an umbrella term for a set of manufacturing processes that use stationary "machine tools" to modify the "workpiece", most commonly by removing material through some form of cutting action. These processes can produce exceptionally precise parts and, with a skilled machinist, can also produce exceptionally **accurate**[^1] parts.

There is a LOT to learn about machining. Not just information, but also methods and mindset. Fortunately, there are many excellent resources to learn the basics.
