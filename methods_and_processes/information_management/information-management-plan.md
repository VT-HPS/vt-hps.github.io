# Information Management Plan

As a design team, HPS generates and uses a lot of information. Stored information is only useful if specific items can be located when needed, and this requires some level of organization. However, the more intricate a system is, the less likely it is to survive being passed between Datamasters. This section of the wiki lays out a plan and reasoning for how information will be organized in order to balanace the competing objectives of easy access and long-term durability.

## Ways to look at information

!!TODO!! //visual of chronological vs topic


Information on this wiki is divided by topic.

This is in contrast to the team SharePoint, which is primarily divided by time of authorship.


Wherever possible, follow a "one source of truth" model. 
>For example: if you are writing a page about growing bananas, do not write your own section on how to measure soil ph; instead you should link to the existing page that describes how to measure soil ph. This reduces how much work you have to do and makes sure that if a better method of soil ph measurement is discovered, only one page needs to be updated, not every single page that describes that procedure.
