# Access Requirements
To access the waterjet at the AEDL, you must be trained on the waterjet, which requires Ware Lab machine shop certification. If you have WL machine shop certification and would like to be trained to operate the waterjet, talk to your LE.

# Startup procedure
1. Sign in on the user log clipboard (leave machine hours column blank)
2. Turn off the wall box's breaker switch
3. Inspect the water line to make sure all valves are open (handle inline with pipe)
4. Turn on the machine's main breaker (Located on the side of the machine facing the door)
4. Inspect the pump for water leakage at weap holes. If any water is visible, stop immediately and notify Bob (AEDL manager)
5. Check the level of abrasive media in the feed canister using the stick. If the yellow tape is in the canister, the level of abraisive is low. To load more abrasive, place the sieve over the canister and pour 1 bag of garnet through the sieve to break up any large clusters.
6. Pressurize the garnet feed canister: 1) lift the handle so that the plug closes against the top of the canister, 2) open the valve next to the rim of the canister. Once the valve is open, the pressure will keep the plug in place. CAUTION: if you open the valve before closing the plug, it will spray abrasive media out.
7. On the machine control, press the green "Driver Power" button
8. The machine is now ready for use.

# Shutdown procedure
1. If in FlowCUT, exit Run Machine mode by clicking the blue return arrow under the Cycle Start button.
2. Close FlowCUT
3. Wash down the table using the hose coiled under the wall mounted electrical box
4. Turn off the machine's main breaker
5. Turn off the wall box's breaker switch 
6. Write down the listed machine hours on the user log clipboard
7. Depressurize the abrasive media pod by closing the valve on the rim. The plug will drop.
8. The machine is now shut down.
